# FilmQueryProject

#### Description

In this project, we were to create an application that retrieves and displays film data.
When started, the user was presented with a menu, asking the user to choose 1. Look up a film by ID, 2. Look up a film by search key word, 3. Exit the application.

#### Lessons learned

We made an application merging data bases and java, using SQL and Java. While I had a pretty good understanding of the java used in this program, this helped solidify a lot of things in my head. As always, practice makes perfect. I still need to brush up on exceptions, try catch blocks, and a little bit of interfaces. SQL is still new to me. I need to get better at writing SQL statements that bridge and join two tables.

#### Technologies used
SQL, Eclipse, Java, Methods, Interfaces, try -catch, loops, lists, array lists, and this stuff : Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, user, password);

			String sql = "SELECT name FROM language WHERE id = ?;";
			PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql);

      I forgot the name for that specific technology. Would it fall under java or sql?

#### What was Fun
This application was very fun to make. It gave me a small glimpse of the types of applications we will make further into the program. While it was not logic heavy, I still enjoyed putting java and SQL together and having them run.
